# doxygen_cmake_example
Example project using doxygen to document a cmake project.
[Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/)

Documentations can be generated automatically by adding a paragraph in the CMakeLists.txt, and using a specific commenting convention in code.

Really helpful for large project where the naming and class relations are complicated.
